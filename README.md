# Spotify-Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis Journal Article
My team and I worked on an exploratory data analysis project examining what makes a Spotify song successful. We used the datasets [Spotify 1.2M+ Songs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs/data) and [Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023?resource=download) to explore how
- Release Date: How did release dates affect how songs performed in 2023?
- Major, Minor, and Key: How did streams vary by song key?
- Danceability and Energy: Do people like songs that they can dance to?
- Artists: Who did people listen to the most?
- Speechiness: How does “wordiness” affect streams?
- Cross-Platform Analysis: How did the top songs perform on Spotify versus Apple Music?

impact a song's popularity on Spotify

### Conclusion
In conclusion, we found that the following attributes correlate to successful Spotify hits:

- People tend to listen to happier songs!
- Good news for dancers: music has gotten more danceable through the years.
- Songs that are solos or duets are more successful than collaborations with 3+ artists.
- Songs that have higher energy levels are more frequently added to Spotify charts and playlists
- The most popular songs tend to be less “wordy”, but their effects on performance are not as drastic
- High-performing songs (500 million+ streams and in more than 5000 playlists) tend to stay below a “speechiness” of 35%.

However, we also noted that having the attributes of what we deemed to be 'successful' do not guarantee the success of a Spotify song, and that with the variability of time, trends, and other confounding factors, it is difficult to obtain a grasp on the attributes of the “perfect” song.
